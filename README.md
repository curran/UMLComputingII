Resources for the course Computing II at UMass Lowell (Spring 2014).

## For Students

Your first real assignment, due 2/20 by midnight, submitted to `curran_kelleher@student.uml.edu`, is a complete implementation of your MyString module, using the API definition found in `mystring.h`. You can use the `IntArray` module and unit tests provided by Derrell Lipman as an example of how to organize your code.

 * Submit a ZIP file containing:
   * mystring.h - unmodified
   * mystring.c
   * demo.c or main.c - tests some of the function
   * tests.c - based on the texts.c from IntArray, modified to test the MyString functions
