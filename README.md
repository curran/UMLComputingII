==============

Resources for the course Computing II at UMass Lowell (Spring 2014).

## For Students

Due 3/28:

 * Complete MyString implementation based on [mystring.h](https://github.com/curran/UMLComputingII/blob/master/mystring.h)
 * Running unit tests based on [Derrell's framework](https://github.com/curran/UMLComputingII/tree/master/mystring-unit-test)
 * Will email over Spring Break with details on how to submit

## C Reference

To compile and run your code, say `main.c`, use the following commands:

```
gcc main.c
./a.out
```

To compile and link multiple files, like you need to do in your assignment, use a command like this:

```
gcc main.c mystring.c
```

These standard compiler flags are recommended:

```
gcc main.c -Wall -std=c99
```
