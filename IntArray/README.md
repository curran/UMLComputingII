This directory contains code written by Derrell Lipman, distributed to Computing II students on 2/8/2014.

## To students

This code is a complete example of an opaque object API implementation. You are to use this example code as a reference example for implementing your own opaque object API, MyString.

You should also write unit tests for all functions of your MyString module, using `tests.c` as an example implementation.

This work is due on 2/20/2014 by midnight. Please submit a ZIP file of your code to `curran_kelleher@student.uml.edu`.

Good luck!
